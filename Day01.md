# What is DevOps?

## Overview

**DevOps** is a culture and set of practices that bring **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)** together to deliver software **faster**, **more reliably**, and with **higher quality**.

Instead of developers writing code and “throwing it over the wall” to operations, DevOps promotes **collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback**. This helps teams build, test, release, and maintain software efficiently.

## Why DevOps?

Traditional software delivery often suffers from:

* Slow releases
* Manual processes
* Poor communication between teams
* Late detection of bugs

DevOps addresses these challenges by improving the entire software delivery lifecycle.

## Key DevOps Principles

### 🔹 Automation

* Reduces manual effort
* Minimizes human errors
* Speeds up development and deployment

### 🔹 Continuous Testing

* Detects bugs early
* Ensures code quality at every stage
* Reduces production failures

### 🔹 Quality

* Delivers stable and reliable releases
* Improves user experience
* Builds trust in deployments

### 🔹 Continuous Monitoring

* Tracks application and system performance
* Detects issues in real time
* Enables faster recovery and improvements

## Benefits of DevOps

* Faster software delivery
* Better collaboration between teams
* Higher quality applications
* Improved system reliability
* Consistent and repeatable deployments
